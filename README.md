Hello World,

My name is Steve. I want to leave the Brown world. It has nice benefits, but it 
extracts a heavy price. The benefits are there for the taking, but one hand is 
always handcuffed to the mothership. There is no other way. The only way out is 
to let go of the benefits. That way, the other hand gets released, and you are 
freed.
